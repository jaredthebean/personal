            Worked in Golang mostly. Built a service to route different customer service requests to
            different teams based on who was best able to handle them. Did a good bit of back-and-forth
            with internal (non-technical) teams to get it just right. Somehow it was my first real
            experience of encoding and improving a previously spreadsheet based "solution".

                Tried to protect Duolingo from various spam and abuse threats as the sole full-time
                employee on the case (others would join during an outage/"war room".)
              </p>
              <p>
                I was kinda all over the place here technologically. Got some (more) experience in 
                Android and browser frontends as I added a CAPTCHA to protect the sign-up flow
                (with a tiny dip of the toes in iOS.) It was my first time using a paid DDoS product
                as well.  Shout out to Fastly for being really nice to work with. And of course did
                my standard backend type work in Python (and some Java.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Did some standard anti-spam & abuse protections work for user-generated content by
                finding existing signals, analyzing them to discover decent combinations and
                thresholds that seemed to differentiate known good accounts vs known bad accounts,
                and then used those thresholds to create rules to deny probable spammers from doing
                a protected action ("posting", creating an account, etc.)

                Well the English Test product got real popular over the pandemic so the first bit
                of this was just scaling the tech and making sure it didn't fall over. There wasn't
                as much to do here as I initially feared besides watch the numbers go up as we
                built it well, and there are <em>only so many</em> students taking English exams
                even if you hit 100% market share. Still 20x growth over a month or two can make any
                SWE nervous. Excited, but nervous.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shortly thereafter the main goal became ensuring the integrity of our test in terms
                of anti-cheat functionality. I founded and headed up that team. We moved the app
                from being browser-based to an ElectronJS desktop app. This let us keep a lot of our
                familiar webdev-y code of which the company had an excellent pool of talent, and I
                could focus on providing a good C++ glue layer to give us access to desktop APIs in
                TypeScript land for all the anti-cheat signals we needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                An interesting engineering challenge to be sure, but probably my favorite part was
                mentoring all the new hires that came on at that time and growing them with good
                tasks suitable to their level. By the time I left the team was more than capable to
                operate without me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Oh yeah, I also lead the company internal Python users group during this time as
                well as helped maintain the internal Python library used by Duolingo's backend 
                services.

                A simpler time - or perhaps one with different challenges. The English Test team
                was still a singular team and not a sub-org at Duolingo. Market share was quite
                small and all we were trying to do was get noticed by the big universities and
                attract more users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Worked on ads and setting up our ads/performance marketing team for success -
                mostly by setting up metrics tracking and doing 1001 UI and product experiments.
                Did get us 80% YoY growth, though this would be dwarfed soon enough. Also did a
                good bit of JavaScript/TypeScript bloat reduction that improved our load
                performance (30%). Got some "free" SEO and ads cost reduction (-35%) from that.
                Always nice to see real world goodies come from performance improvements. It
                appeases my engineering soul I think.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also got my first taste of mentorship when the first junior engineer joined the
                team.  Soon <em>they</em> were the ones doing the 1001 UI experiments though I did
                help them transition the code base to TypeScript and React.

                Needed a year to prove that I was a senior engineer. Was kinda nice to have the
                pressure at a lower setting for that time.

                Mostly got us off of a technically working, but full of pitfalls and potholes
                homegrown JavaScript 'compiler'.
                Webpack was a dream comparatively (and is what I moved us to.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Also did a lot of work on switching up how the entire exam worked: big UI changes,
                big backend changes, support for productionizing new grading models - the works.
                Basically a new product by the end of it.

            First job out of college. Glad to have really great teammates. First time working across
            time-zones (Singapore - Brazil - San Francisco.) Mostly worked on making a common
            front-end infrastructure so that different Google products could have customizable
            "report-abuse" flow that reported this abuse to us in systematic way with good
            metadata.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did mostly Android on the front-end (with other team members covering iOS and web) and
            the backend jobs to product good metrics (counts, etc.) and other signals from these
            reports.
