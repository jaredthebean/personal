      <h1>Hello & Welcome!</h1>
      <p>My name (and domain ü•Å) is Jared Bean.</p>
      <p>
        I currently live in western Pennsylvania in the United States and am
      <ul>
        <li>a software developer</li>
        <li>
          a homeowner discovering how houses and their systems are
          put together and maintained
        </li>
        <li>
          a father and husband - which I'm still a little surprised about
        </li>
        <li>
          a mentor and teacher for junior engineers
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is my website. You'll find a little R√©sum√© and Tech Blog on it, but not too much more.
        I've written it mostly in direct HTML &amp; CSS with an aim of keeping
        JavaScript/TypeScript to a minimum. I wanted it a bit minimal and <em>fast</em> and honestly
        I felt like I have gotten too used to JavaScript frameworks doing the heavy lifting (and their
        bundle sizes weighing in heavy as well) and wanted to reacquaint myself with the other
        web technologies available.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a multi-page-application (MPA), because of its blog-ish nature as well as because
        I'd gotten to used to writing things as single-page-applications (SPAs.)
